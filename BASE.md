# What is it ?

This extension is an extension made to formalize git commit messages. By using a template and variables, you can define how the commit message needs to looks and which data you want in this message.

By example: When you want to specify a **scope** in your commits, you can create a variable named scope in th e template like this `{scope}`

If you want to specify which data you want in this scope variable, you can specify it with the variable settings

```json
{
  "scope": [
    {
      "label": "ðŸŸ¢ App"
    },
    {
      "label": "ðŸŸ  Api"
    },
    {
      "label": "ðŸ”µ Scripts"
    }
  ]
}
```

I show you more on the #Settings part
